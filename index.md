# Bitstream Computing Hackathon at UW-Madison

## Welcome to **BCH@UW!**
This hackathon will give you a chance to learn about ultra low-power neural networks, how they are designed, how they are programmed or trained, and how they are used to process sensory data from the real world.

When you participate, you will learn:
- a new programming language (Julia)
- about low-cost, ultra-low computing using Bitstreams as a data type
- how to train a powerful neural network called MobileNet
- how to prune/tune/quantize this network to make it energy efficient

The **BCH@UW** Hackathon kicks off on Sat 4/30 at 1pm in EH2261.
In the meantime, you can work through the tutorials on this website to get started with the tools and optimization flows.
